# Introduction
> "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for." - William G.T.
 
This website is a resource that students and software engineers can use to prepare for their upcoming coding interviews. It is a comprehensive guide detailing patterns and algorithms that often appear during the technical interview. Written and developed by [@jessebinghan](https://www.instagram.com/jessebinghan/) through experience, practice and research.

## Features
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Quickly understand the basics of data structures
- :thought_balloon: Learn to recognize popular coding question patterns
- :book: Concisely written to avoid lengthy reading time
- :pencil2: Elegantly commented for comprehension
- :link: Sidebar organized into distinctive weeks for optimal progress

## Learning

_Suggested learning strategy:_ Read the question prompt and attempt the problem until stuck. At this stage, your brain will do the most learning. Similar to maximal muscle growth in the gym when nearing failure, you want your brain to try to complete the question until absolutely all ideas are exhausted (_est. 30 min_). At this point, read the approach given and code out the solution on an IDE of your choice. Then, you may check the source code provided to cross-reference for mistakes.
