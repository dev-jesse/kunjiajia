This website is a resource that students and software engineers can use to prepare for their upcoming coding interviews. It is a comprehensive guide detailing patterns and algorithms that often appear during the technical interview. Written and developed by [@jessebinghan](https://www.instagram.com/jessebinghan/) through experience, practice and research.

## Learning

_Suggested learning strategy:_
1. Read the problem and give yourself around 5 minutes to just think of a solution, there is no need to use a keyboard at this point
2. If you can determine an approach, then you may code it up and solve the problem
3. If the problem cannot be solved within 30 min, pull up the _Solutions_ tab and read an approach from one of the top posts
4. Implement the approach yourself, and if you cannot do that then read the source code and return to this problem at a later date
