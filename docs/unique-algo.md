# Unique Algorithms
> "The harder I work, the luckier I get." - Samuel Goldwyn

In specific questions, there will be optimized solutions that are so widely accepted as the "best" or "sneaky" way to solve the problem that it will be given an algorithm. In this section, I will discuss some unique algorithms created that will impress your interviewer if given the chance apply the knowledge to solve a problem.

## Rabin Karp
Prerequisites: [Hash function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-hash-functions-and-how-to-choose-a-good-hash-function/)

Recommended: [Hashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-1-introduction/), [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
### Overview
A naive string matching algorithm compares the pattern with every character in the text. The Rabin-Karp algorithm achieves speedup through the usage of a hash function.
